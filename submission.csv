ImageCLEFmedical_Caption_2024_valid_000160,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the strongest known risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB), and the risk of developing active TB in people living with HIV (PLWH) is 15–22 times higher than in people without HIV [1]. Active TB may develop at any stage of HIV infection, but the risk correlates negatively with CD4+ cells count. TB is the leading cause of morbidity, hospitalisations, and mortality in PLWH [1]. There were 214,000 deaths due to TB among HIV-positive people in 2020 worldwide, which accounted for 31.5% of all HIV-related deaths [1,2]. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for TB in HIV-positive patients, and for HIV infection in newly diagnosed TB patients [3,4,5]. Around 16% of all PLWH do not know that they are infected with HIV [1], and about 25% of incident HIV patients present to care with advanced disease [3]. Immunosuppression caused by HIV infection affects clinical and radiologic presentation of TB. Atypical TB presentation is often observed in the late stages of HIV infection [6,7,8,9]. Such atypical TB presentation in a person with HIV infection not yet diagnosed, may be challenging, as described below. A 42-year-old woman of Indian origin was referred to a respiratory medicine department after her chest X-ray (Figure 1) revealed nodular opacifications in the lungs and bilateral pleural effusion (arrows). The patient had a 4-month history of unspecific chest and feet pains, mild dry cough, fatigue, reduced appetite, and body weight loss of 6 kg. She denied dyspnoea, sputum expectoration, haemoptysis, night sweats, or fever. On admission to the hospital, she was in good condition, her vital signs were normal, BMI was 19.2. There was no palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy or oedema; the vesicular breathing sound was reduced bibasiliary on chest auscultation. Blood tests showed elevated CRP—109.4 (N:<5) mg/L and ERS—120 (N: < 12), normal procalcitonin, normal leukocyte and neutrophil counts, decreased lymphocyte count—0.84 × 103 (N:1.18 × 103–3.74 × 103) cells/mm3."

ImageCLEFmedical_Caption_2024_valid_002251,"Point-of-care ultrasonography image demonstrating the “whirlpool sign” (arrows) over the mesenteric vessels as indicated by their presentation in a spiral shape. Abdominal pain is the most common complaint in the emergency department (ED) [1,2]. Acute abdominal pain can be caused by a spectrum of conditions ranging from benign and self-limited diseases to surgical emergencies. Abdominal pain is caused by a variety of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders. Some frequently missed conditions include biliary pathology, appendicitis [3], diverticulitis, urogenital pathology, and even vascular emergency [1]. Therefore, the rapid and early detection of urgent conditions is crucial for managing patients efficiently. The combination of clinical and laboratory evaluation cannot reliably predict or exclude urgent conditions and can result in unnecessary or delayed interventions. Further diagnostic imaging such as point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) can help in the early identification of the cause of abdominal pain [4,5] and increase the certainty of the diagnosis [6]. The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) defines clinical ultrasonography as a diagnostic modality that provides clinically significant data that are not obtainable by inspection, palpation, auscultation, or other components of the physical examination [7]. POCUS performed and interpreted by physicians at the bedside has grown rapidly in recent decades [8], as current ultrasound equipment has become less expensive, higher quality and more compact. The use of bedside ultrasonography (or insonation), incorporated with traditional inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation have become the five pillars of bedside clinical medicine [9]. As an extension of the physical examination [10], a more generalized concept of an “ultrasound stethoscope” is used to provide directed clinical assessments [11,12]. It could provide immediate, real-time dynamic images that are correlated with a patient’s clinical condition and are easily repeatable. The main goal of POCUS in ED is to rapidly rule in or rule out a dangerous diagnosis and to solve clinical problems, such as evaluating the cause of shock [13]; shortness of breath [14]; chest pain; fever; and muscular, skeleton, or soft tissue swelling and pain [15,16] before laboratory tests. It can also help to guide the procedure [17,18] and allow checking for complications to promote patient safety [19]. Moreover, it can be used as a first-line tool for the evaluation of abdominal pain after taking the patient’s history and conducting a physical examination [4,5,20,21]. The use of ultrasonography can enable the detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain and can decrease unnecessary radiation exposure [6], decrease the need for further examinations, and decrease the frequency with which patients are admitted [22]. Nevertheless, ultrasonography is an extremely operator-dependent modality of testing. Acquiring the skills to properly manipulate and interpret images for safe integration with clinical work takes years to master [20,23]. There are many factors that can affect the quality of POCUS and the decision making involved, such as patient factors, the operator’s skills in image acquisition and interpretation, and machine quality [11]. It is important to be able to identify and differentiate artifacts and false positives and negatives to overcome the pitfalls of POCUS [24,25]. Therefore, POCUS education has been integrated into postgraduate-year training, and emergency resident training is important. It will result in physicians having more self-confidence to overcome the barriers for implementing POCUS in clinical practice. Here, we present an unusual case of abdominal pain after jejunostomy tube insertion with the use of POCUS for diagnosis. A 51-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer presented to the emergency department due to a jejunostomy tube that had been accidentally dislodged without causing abdominal pain and hemodynamically stable. A few minutes after the introduction of a new tube, the patient complained of diffuse abdominal pain. Upon examination, his body temperature was 36.6 °C, his pulse rate was 79 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 90/45 mmHg, and his respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. The physical examination revealed a soft abdomen without rebounding tenderness or muscle guarding. The jejunostomy tube functioned well, and laboratory tests were unremarkable. The source of abdominal pain was considered benign. However, analgesic agents could not relieve abdominal pain. We performed POCUS for persistent abdominal pain to rule out bowel perforation or other dangerous etiology such as vascular emergencies, and it demonstrated mesenteric vessels presenting in a whirlpool sign, namely, in a whirling or spiral shape (Figure 1, Video S1). We tried to remove the tube; however, it could not be moved and induced progressive pain. It prompted the use of computed tomography (CT) (Figure 2, Video S2). This confirmed the presence of a small-bowel volvulus with a whirlpool sign over the jejunal branches of the superior mesenteric vessels. A surgeon was consulted, and this patient underwent surgical correction of the volvulus, without subsequent complications."

ImageCLEFmedical_Caption_2024_valid_002291,"and Video S1: A 32-year-old primigravid woman underwent obstetric ultrasound at 32 weeks of gestation because of a small-for-date uterine size. Her medical history as well as familial history was unremarkable; no underlying medical disease and no history of any pelvic surgery. The antenatal course of the current pregnancy was uneventful. Ultrasound screening for fetal anomaly at 20 weeks of pregnancy revealed normal structures and fetal biometry, with no records of pelvic pathology on sonographic examination. Ultrasound examination at this visit (32 weeks of pregnancy) showed a slightly delayed growth of the fetus (estimated fetal weight of 15th percentile). Interestingly, a cystic mass at the right adnexa, close to the lower uterine segment was noted. The mass was measured as 3.0 × 4.5 × 3.0 cm in size, well-circumscribed, unilocular, and had homogeneous low-level echoes, with swirling flow in the mass, which can be clearly visualized on the simple 2D ultrasound as seen in Figure 1 and video S1 (a supplementary file). A uterine artery aneurysm was highly suspected upon 2D ultrasound. Aneurysms of the uterine artery are rare and with an unknown true prevalence. The entity can be categorized into two groups, pseudoaneurysms and true aneurysms. Pseudoaneurysms are abnormal outpouchings or the dilatation of arteries which are bounded only by the tunica adventitia, the outermost layer of the arterial wall, whereas true aneurysms are bounded by all three layers of the arterial wall. Pseudoaneurysms typically occur when a blood vessel wall is injured and the leaking blood collects in the surrounding tissue. They can occur in patients of all ages, typically following penetrating or blunt trauma, infection, dissection, excessive effort, or as a complication of a cesarean section [1]. True aneurysms occur when the artery or vessel weakens and bulges, sometimes forming a blood-filled sac. True aneurysms of uterine arteries are extremely rare. To the best of our knowledge, a very limited number of isolated case reports have been published in the literature [2,3]. Moreover, a true aneurysm of the uterine artery has never been described during pregnancy. Therefore, its natural history remains unexplored. Nearly all cases reported in the literature are pseudoaneurysms. Additionally, most published pelvic true aneurysms involved ruptured ovarian artery aneurysms during peripartum periods [4,5,6,7,8]. The case presented here is unique in terms of being an unruptured true aneurysm of the uterine artery at the time of diagnosis and with the spontaneous development of thrombosis in the aneurysm in late pregnancy."
ImageCLEFmedical_Caption_2024_valid_002292,"Color flow ultrasound of the same mass at a follow-up ultrasound at 37 weeks of gestation shows changes in the active flow of the cyst, now as an inactive hemorrhagic heterogeneous mass without internal color flow, even at the low PRF setting, as presented in Figure 4. The finding suggested that the aneurysm had become thrombotic. Cesarean section was performed at 39 weeks of gestation because of a breech presentation, giving birth to a healthy female newborn with Apgar scores of 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 min. The operative finding revealed the unruptured thrombotic aneurysm close to the right uterine isthmus and cardinal ligament. The thrombotic uterine artery was approximately 4 cm in length and 1 cm in diameter with a saccular-like area of 2 cm in width connected to the uterus. The patient had an uneventful postpartum period but did not attend a follow-up at 6 weeks postpartum. Clinical Impact. An unruptured true aneurysm of the uterine artery can be detected by one of the following techniques: (1) Color Doppler ultrasound finding an intrauterine mass or a mass connected to the uterus with swirling blood flow, with a to-and-fro pattern; (2) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealing an enhanced, sac-like structure within the uterus or connected to the uterus; (3) computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirming the presence of sac-like structure with a connection to the uterine artery. Preoperatively, differentiating a true aneurysm from a pseudoaneurysm may be based on the presence of a prior history of trauma or infection, pelvic surgery or cesarean section. Nevertheless, definite diagnosis relies on either finding intact vascular wall layers in the operative field or pathological discovery. A uterine artery pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula, probably also a true aneurysm, is usually detected after the rupture of lesions, resulting in a spontaneous massive hemorrhage or after uterine curettage [9]. Pathologically, pseudoaneurysms usually consist of only one layer of loose connective tissue, different from true aneurysms which consist of a complete three-layered wall. Extraluminal swirling blood flow can lead to the enlargement of the pseudoaneurysm, making it susceptible to rupture and serious bleeding. The natural course and prognosis of true aneurysms are not known. However, it should be considered a serious condition and a difficult cesarean section in the category of laceration or organ damage [10], which can cause massive hemorrhage, leading to a life-threatening scenario. Knowing in advance the potential surgical difficulties allows the surgeon to plan the best strategies. Nevertheless, theoretically, true aneurysms may be less susceptible to rupture than pseudoaneurysms since they have a more secure vascular wall because of intact complete vascular wall layers. However, high precaution must be exercised, especially in late pregnancy and early postpartum. It might be life-threatening as seen in true aneurysms of the ovarian arteries, which are normally detected upon rupture in up to 50% of cases during the peripartum period [4,5,6,7,8], probably because of the anatomical changes in the vessel during the pregnancy, facilitating the weakening of the arterial wall. Additionally, the hormonal and hemodynamic changes induced by pregnancy may lead to the development of these aneurysms. The development of the aneurysm in our case might have been induced by the pregnancy, occurring in the second half of pregnancy since it was not documented during the ultrasound examination at mid-pregnancy. However, it was possible that a pre-existing lesion might have been an overlooked anomaly and missed during routine screening. The management of the aneurysm may follow the guidelines for pseudoaneurysms, such as open laparotomy for hysterectomy or ligation of the uterine artery or internal iliac artery, uterine balloon tamponade and laparoscopic surgery for the treatment [11,12] of transarterial embolization [13]. However, proper management during pregnancy is challenging. Uterine artery or hypogastric artery ligation during pregnancy certainly has a higher risk and needs expertise, as well as the consideration of possible adverse effects on the pregnancy and the fetus. Theoretically, uterine artery embolization is also associated with a negative impact on the pregnancy. Thus, our patient preferred a conservative treatment with close monitoring. Interestingly, the case presented here spontaneously developed a thrombosis in the aneurysm and needed no further treatment. The spontaneous thrombosis was described before by Borghese et al. [1], who described a true uterine artery aneurysm incidentally detected in a 39-year-old Caucasian female patient who was asymptomatic and not pregnant. The CTA showed that the aneurysm arose from the right uterine artery, measuring 13 mm in maximal diameter. The patient refused any treatment and the CTA 3 months later showed spontaneous thrombosis of the aneurysm. Accordingly, spontaneous thrombolysis might represent one of the possible natural outcomes and close follow-up with imaging should be performed, especially during pregnancy, as seen in our case. In summary, we described a unique case of a true aneurysm of the uterine artery diagnosed at 32 weeks of gestation by the demonstration of an adnexal cystic mass with swirling flow consistent with the uterine artery, connected with the uterine isthmus. If ruptured, the aneurysm placed the patient at high risk of massive hemorrhage. However, spontaneous thrombosis occurred in late gestation, ending with a successful outcome through expectant management."

A representative axial image reveals complete resolution of the lung lesions that were observed in the earlier PET/CT scan. Discussion Although 18F-FDG PET/CT has achieved great success in investigating malignant disorders, the imaging modality is not only specific for cancer diagnosis [13]. Since the activated inflammatory cells showed an increased expression and up-regulation of glucose transport receptors, several studies have reported the presence of high FDG uptake in acute and chronic infectious diseases such as mycobacterial, fungal, bacterial infection, sarcoidosis, radiation pneumonitis, and postoperative inflammation [14,15,16]. In this case report, we evaluated the utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT in a patient with a suspected metastatic infectious disease, and showed that it can visualize the correct foci leading to therapeutic management. CRBSI is associated with significant morbidity due to systemic infection and causes septic pulmonary emboli, which originate from the extrapulmonary site transported to the lung [17]. Like this case, clinical symptoms of septic pulmonary emboli are usually non-specific, and an active extrapulmonary focus of the infection might be apparent at the time of presentation, especially in cancer patients on chemotherapy via an indwelling central venous catheter for long durations. In conclusion, 18F-FDG PET/CT can detect septic pulmonary emboli in patients with catheter-related Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This case report suggests that cancer patients with CRBSI might benefit from 18F-FDG PET/CT for a timely evaluation of metastatic infection and optimal management. In accordance with previous studies suggesting the clinical value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with Gram-positive bacteremia [5,10,11,18,19,20], we believe that the benefit from 18F-FDG PET/CT might be mediated by infective foci detection, earlier interventions to control infection, and the prolongation of antimicrobial treatment."
